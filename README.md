# SafeSpend: Expense Tracker with GraphQL and React

## About The Project

This project is an Expense Tracker, a web application that allows users to manage their personal finances by tracking income and expenses. It leverages the power of GraphQL for efficient data handling and ReactJS for an interactive user interface.

This project served as an educational journey through the world of GraphQL and how it can be integrated with React and authentication mechanisms like Passport.

### Built With
- **GraphQL**: Used for the API layer to enable clients to query and mutate data.
- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend.
